# composite_images
The python script performs a variety of image processing tasks such as convolution using Fourier transforms, and deconvolution, to eventually produce a composite image of Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe. The image in e.txt (Einstein) and m.txt (Monroe) are in grayscale on a scale of 0 to 1.
